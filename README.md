# latte-rsa
This is my tiny little RSA encryption implementation that I created for fun when I started working with python's cryptography library. It takes its name from my deceased cat, Latte, who was also tiny. Latte would also make the necessary things in the house unattainable in a way that I don't know how she did it.
